            <h1  className='text-4xl mb-4'>HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT: INNOVATION THROUGH EXECUTION</h1>
            <p className='text-base text-gray-600'>We believe that laboratory certification is achieved by using the combined talents of a team of biocontainment engineers and biosafety professionals who utilize cutting edge technology. We deliver innovation as a designed outcome, not happenstance. No other certification company can match the number of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certified TSI meters WBHT owns and maintains. We have enough TSI meters to certify a full Vivarium in one day. That means you can get back into your laboratory in minimal time and continue your research. We have worked with laboratories that use the most advanced technologies for conducting research including bioimaging, telemetry, effluent decontamination systems, and stem cell research. World BioHazTec has inspected hundreds of laboratories throughout the United States and the world, which has given us a global perspective on how laboratories operate. We know what it takes to have a laboratory function safely and securely at your location.</p>
